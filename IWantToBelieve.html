This one appeared to drive other people nuts, along with me, who also did not know about the GIF tool I should use (https://dtm.uk/gif-steganography/)
I tried using steghide, and it asked for a passphrase.
I tried "stegosuite gui," and it just yanked the regular gif file. I again complained about a passphrase.

Next, I attempted to use various passphrases, but no luck! They were all parts of things I found in the text, which is here:

We've received a GIFt from what appears to be a signal coming from extraterrestrial life! Although it appears they've used steganography
to hide it inside of this .gif file. All we know is that it's in the form of a text file named 'iwanttobelieve.txt'. Can you recover it?

Well, once we did a git clone of the tool, it found everything easy. These were my commands (where gift.gif is the download file):
git clone https://github.com/dtmsecurity/gift.git
cd gift
python3 gift-cli.py analyze ../gift.gif
python3 gift-cli.py --source ../gift.gif recover recovered.txt
cat recovered.txt
