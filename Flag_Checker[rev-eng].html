This one requires you to either be good at python/programming or good at asking an AI the right questions.
I like to think of myself as an intermediate at both of those, but I have minimal python experience (my only OOP
has been in C++ and Java).

The challenge is as follows:
We found this cryptic Python script that validates the user's flag, but we're having trouble understanding the code. Can you find the correct flag that passes through the program?

The code they provided is as follows:
┌──(trhodes㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ cat pyrev.py
phoneSteak = [55, 33, 52, 40, 35, 56, 86, 90, 66, 111, 81, 26, 23, 75, 109, 26, 88, 90, 75, 67, 92, 25, 87, 88, 92, 84, 23, 88]

libraryDiscussion = input("Enter the flag: ")
confusedSheep = [ord(herdSlot) for herdSlot in libraryDiscussion]
mintFarm = len(confusedSheep)
trustBreed = len(phoneSteak)

seaTent = 6
callCover = 17
foxEmbox = (248 // trustBreed) % trustBreed
outfitStrike = 10
brushCopy = (341 // trustBreed) % 17
injectPush = (1240 + 28 // trustBreed) % trustBreed

makeupRoof = []
tinRoyalty = []
if trustBreed == mintFarm:
    for heartCool in confusedSheep:
        makeupRoof.append(heartCool - 27)
    for angelStay in makeupRoof:
        tinRoyalty.append(angelStay ^ 15)

    franchisePath = tinRoyalty[seaTent]
    tinRoyalty[seaTent] = tinRoyalty[injectPush]
    tinRoyalty[injectPush] = franchisePath
    eastGhostwriter  = tinRoyalty[outfitStrike]

    tinRoyalty[outfitStrike] = tinRoyalty[foxEmbox]
    tinRoyalty[foxEmbox] = eastGhostwriter
    personPioneer = tinRoyalty[callCover]

    tinRoyalty[callCover] = tinRoyalty[brushCopy]
    tinRoyalty[brushCopy] = personPioneer

    lineMoon = tinRoyalty[0 : len(tinRoyalty) // 2]
    puddingCommission = tinRoyalty[len(tinRoyalty) // 2 : len(tinRoyalty)]
    furRegret = lineMoon + puddingCommission[::-1]
    tinRoyalty = furRegret

    if tinRoyalty == phoneSteak:
        print("Correct!! :)")
    else:
        print("Incorrect flag :(")

else:
    print("Incorrect :(")


So, the tinRoyalty variable must match the phoneSteak variable. Starting there, the steps are:
- Reverse the reordering step by splitting phoneSteak into two parts, reverse the second half, and concatenate them.
- Now reverse the swaps (reverse the indices in reverse order).
- Reverse the XOR and then subtract.
- Convert the ASCII variables into characters.

I'm not THAT smart, so I asked OpenAI for some help and we came up with the following solution:

The solution:
phoneSteak = [55, 33, 52, 40, 35, 56, 86, 90, 66, 111, 81, 26, 23, 75, 109, 26, 88, 90, 75, 67, 92, 25, 87, 88, 92, 84, 23, 88]

# Reorder reversal
mid = len(phoneSteak) // 2
lineMoon = phoneSteak[:mid]
puddingCommission = phoneSteak[mid:][::-1]
tinRoyalty = lineMoon + puddingCommission

# Swaps reversal
def reverse_swap(lst, idx1, idx2):
    lst[idx1], lst[idx2] = lst[idx2], lst[idx1]

# Indices
seaTent = 6
callCover = 17
foxEmbox = (248 // 28) % 28
outfitStrike = 10
brushCopy = (341 // 28) % 17
injectPush = (1240 + 28 // 28) % 28

# Reverse swaps
reverse_swap(tinRoyalty, callCover, brushCopy)
reverse_swap(tinRoyalty, outfitStrike, foxEmbox)
reverse_swap(tinRoyalty, seaTent, injectPush)

# XOR and subtraction reversal
tinRoyalty = [(x ^ 15) + 27 for x in tinRoyalty]

# Convert to characters
flag = ''.join(chr(x) for x in tinRoyalty)
print("The flag is:", flag)

Placing that into "solution.py" and executing it will print:
┌──(trhodes㉿kali)-[~/Downloads]
└─$ python solution.py
The flag is: SIVBGR{pyth0n_r3v3rs1ng_pr0}
