Web hunts are interesting because some will have three parts, some will have five, you never know until you find the last part.
Right after opening the front page and I saw a website, I just instinctively went to the robots.txt file which contained
the following entries:

User-agent: Humans

Disallow: /secret-bot-spot

p2: 0f_th3_

So now we see that this is part 2 and it shows a special hiding place. Checking this page has a cute little robot that moves around
the page, but the page source had zero additional information. At first, I thought it was like the front page but with a little robot
but no, it's different, just the main page button is there. This was obvious when looking at the source, no additional parts but it
did include a <script> entry for pulling a javascript file, so I viewed the source of that and found this:
// p3: r0b0ts!}

We now know there are only three parts, and I was ready to start looking in cookies, ETags, and other headers, but no, going back
to the front page and viewing the source found the other part:

   <!-- Don't forget to check in on the bots! -->
    <!-- p1: SIVBGR{r1s3_ -->

Final answer: SIVBGR{r1s3_0f_th3_r0b0ts!}
