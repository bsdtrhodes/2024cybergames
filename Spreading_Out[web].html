Spreading out is a flag that's broken apart and hidden in several areas. Sometimes these are fun, sometimes they can be frustrating.
I'd put this in a section of "leans toward frustrating." Like with most of these types of challenges, I instantly look for a
robots.txt and see if it has a flag or a hint to what file might contain a flag or "piece of flag."

https://uscybercombine-s4-spreading-out.chals.io/robots.txt did have a piece of flag AND gave us a hint on how many parts we are
looking for in this challenge. The first one is:

1/5: SIVBGR{ARIA_1s

Moving on, without a recommendation to another file or location, I decided to fuzz this and ffuf found a .env file that contained:
2/5: _spreading_3v3rywh3r3

ffuf found a /readme file that contained:
3/5: _4lw4ys_4nd

Note that ffuf found all of this informating using these two wordlists:
/usr/share/dirbuster/wordlists/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt 
/usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-medium-words.txt

With these wordlists, ffuf also found a wwwlog directory, but we have no read permissions. We're going to hit that, too, very soon.
Maybe it's nothing, but it might be useful.

I began just trying a large wordlist since sometimes ffuf wordlists contain different words based on their usefulness. Since we are
allowed (and expected) to fuzz the site, I figured we could kitchen sink this (throw everything including the kitchen sink at this):

ffuf, using /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/CMS/trickest-cms-wordlist/shopware-all-levels.txt, found a sitemap.xml file which contained number 4:

4/5: _c4nnot_b3

Awesome. While ffuf was running, I also tried some other probes because I found an image file on the page and I also wanted to know if maybe
the flag would be in an ETag, cookie, or header somewhere:

wget -S --save-cookies cookie-jar.txt --keep-session-cookies https://uscybercombine-s4-spreading-out.chals.io/

Nothing in session or cookies, and I couldn't download the main image with wget for some reason, BUT firefox did let me download it,
so that might be a 301 without redirect issue, or I did not copy the link correctly? For the size of the download.png file (396K),
there had to be more to it, so I ran binwalk against it and found something. So, first, trying to get the download.png via wget:

Since I have it with Firefox, we can ignore wget for now and start working on the image itself:

396K    download.png

Why so big? Let's check something:

Yeah, okay, let's get this file:

Looks like a PDF? There is a lot of odd characters here, so, for no other reason than seeing unprintable characters suggesting
that it's further compressed with something else such as bzip2 or something, or something else is going on here. Binwalk again
and WTF, an embedded file inside of an embedded file:

Why are MySQL files inside of a zlib compressed file that was ITSELF INSIDE a download.png image. What a rabbit hole. Let's move on, and
annoyingly, binwalk can't extract these:

I took a walk since it seemed I would have to manually extract these files using the file offset and when I came back,
I noticed in the discord that someone solved this without ever finding the fifth part. So I thought huh, maybe we're just
supposed to complete the sentence. I put parts 1-4 together and noticed that the last word is probably a "l33t" speak
version of stopped. Here is the flag with all four parts:

SIVBGR{ARIA_1s_spreading_3v3rywh3r3_4lw4ys_4nd_c4nnot_b3

So I guessed the last part was: st0pp3d, so let's add that with an underscore and submit this as the flag:

SIVBGR{ARIA_1s_spreading_3v3rywh3r3_4lw4ys_4nd_c4nnot_b3_st0pp3d}

That was it, solved. I still see other people struggling to guess the last part, I think they should try taking a walk as well.
For my own notes, I was going to extract these SQL files like this, I'm only documenting it since it was in my head and I
think it would make a good reference for anyone reading this solve. The reason I am doing things this way is because binwalk did
not extract the files, there might be an issue with how it's reading the files or something else that maybe dtrace/strace could
pick up on if I had more time to debug:

# First MySQL ISAM index file (0xEBC to 0x2A56)
dd if=nextfile of=output_ebc.isam bs=1 skip=3772 count=7066

# MySQL MISAM compressed data file (0x2A56 to 0x413A)
dd if=nextfile of=output_2a56.misam bs=1 skip=10838 count=5860
