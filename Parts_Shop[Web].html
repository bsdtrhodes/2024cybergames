Oh did I enjoy this one, I rarely get a chance to play with XXE. In all fairness, this is my third CTF, so
I had read about XXEs and heard about payloads, but I did not ever play with them. I'm sure that either
TryHackMe or HackTheBox has a room for these, or perhaps they both, but I have not reached that point.
When going to the page, all we see are three parts and a little green plus bar at the bottom. I went
into Burpsuite and started looking at the pages and learned that they are passing data using XML and
I recall the language of the challenge said it's in /flag.txt. A moment of silence for everyone who
tried this URL, because even I did in hopes that it would be that simple. Anyway, viewing the information
from Burp, we see two endpoints:

parts
blueprint

It seems that blueprint is only used to add and the second one lists the parts. So I tested adding a
part with a javascript tag and I never saw an alert() box, so it's my assumption that they were
filtering out tags, and without a database, we may as well look at another method. I had to use Google
to get a quick read up on how XXEs work, and it seems that, so I just tried adding a part. Going to
the front page shows my new part! And the source showed it's part number six thousand something, but
only the first three parts are shown. I now go to the Firefox browser and open the page and I notice
something, my part is't there! Flipping back to Burp, I see that we have a session so I assume the
added parts involve the session ID. So what now? Well, without a need to authenticate but a need to
make sure we keep within the session, I crafted the following shell to create and store and a part (this
is the execution of my payload):

┌──(trhodes㉿kali)-[~/Downloads/USC]
└─$ sh sub_xxe.sh
+ curl -X POST https://uscybercombine-s4-parts-shop.chals.io/blueprint -c cookies.txt -H Content-Type: text/xml -d <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
         <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
         <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///flag.txt" >]>
         <part>

NOTE: I use "-c" to save the cookie data. Even without a login, it will save our session ID to the cookie jar
and I can use it going forward. This output resembles my manual addition, but it's at the command line, so we need
to use that session. I attempted to get the "next part" available but that failed (see my execution here,
as before, with a -x so you can see what I ran):
  
┌──(trhodes㉿kali)-[~/Downloads/USC]
└─$ sh get_xxe.sh
+ curl -X GET https://uscybercombine-s4-parts-shop.chals.io/part/6559 -b cookies.txt -H Content-Type: text/xml
<!doctype html>
<html lang=en>
<title>404 Not Found</title>
<h1>Not Found</h1>
<p>The requested URL was not found on the server. If you entered the URL manually, please check your spelling and try again.</p>

What did this mean to me? It meant that someone must have added an item since I ran my script, or perhaps
several people added items! There are around 1000 players, it's possible such a race condition existed. To make
this easier, I copied the session from the cookies.txt file and flipped back to Burp. Once the Burp window was
was back in front of me, I just did a refresh in the Burp browser and, in the request, I replaced the session ID
with the one created from my script and clicked forward. Tada, flag:

SIVBGR{fu11y_upgr4d3d}

And done! FYI, here are my default scripts:

┌──(trhodes㉿kali)-[~/Downloads/USC]
└─$ cat sub_xxe.sh get_xxe.sh
set -x

curl -X POST https://uscybercombine-s4-parts-shop.chals.io/blueprint \
